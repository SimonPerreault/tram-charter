TURN Revised And Modernized (tram)
----------------------------------

Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) was published as RFC 5766 in April
2010.  Until recently the protocol had only a rather limited deployment.  This
is primarily due to the fact that its primary use case is as one of the NAT
traversal methods of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
framework (RFC 5245).  This inherent dependency on ICE combined with the fact
that ICE itself was slow to achieve widespread adoption because other
alternative mechanisms were historically used by the VoIP industry.  This
situation has changed drastically as ICE, and consequently TURN, are mandatory
to implement in WebRTC, which is a set of technologies developed at the IETF
and W3C aiming to enable Real Time Communication on the Web.

Because of the ubiquity of the Web and of the new opportunities created by the
arrival of WebRTC, there is a renewed interest in TURN and ICE, as evidenced by
the recent work updating the ICE framework, as well as standardizing the URIs
used to access a STUN or TURN server.

The goal of the TRAM Working Group is to consolidate the various initiatives
to update TURN and STUN, including the definition of new transport and
authentication mechanisms that make STUN and TURN more suitable for the WebRTC
environment.  The Working Group will closely coordinate with the appropriate
Working Groups, including RTCWEB and MMUSIC.

The current list of deliverable is:

- Websocket transport for TURN (draft-chenxin-behave-turn-websocket)
- DTLS transport for TURN (draft-petithuguenin-tram-turn-dtls)
- New authentication mechanism for TURN (draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest)
- RFC5389-bis (draft TBD)
- RFC5766-bis (draft TBD).

Goals and Milestones:
