Turn Revised And Modernized (tram)
----------------------------------

TURN was published as RFC 5766 in April 2010.  The protocol had seen a rather
limited deployment since, mostly because its main usage is being one of the
NAT traversal method of the ICE framework (RFC 5245), and ICE was itself slow
to be deployed because other mechanisms were historically used by the VoIP
industry. This situation is about to change drastically as ICE, and so TURN,
is mandatory
to implement in WebRTC, which is a set of technologies developed at the IETF
and W3C aiming to enable Real Time Communication on the Web.  Because of the
ubiquity of the Web and of the new opportunities created by the arrival of
WebRTC, there is a renewed interest in TURN and in ICE, as seen in the recent
work on updating ICE, or in finalizing the URIs used to resolved the access to
a STUN or TURN server.

The goal of the TRAM Working Group is to consolidate in one place all the
various initiatives in updating TURN and STUN and in defining new mechanisms for
TURN, like authentication or transport, that are more suitable for the WebRTC
environment.  The Working Group aim is to submit all its deliverables in a two
years timeframe, and then close.  The Working will coordinate with the RTCWeb
Working Group.

The current list of deliverable is:

- Websocket transport for TURN (draft-chenxin-behave-turn-websocket)
- DTLS transport for TURN (to be published - Authors Gonzalo Salgueiro, Marc
Petit-Huguenin)
- New authentication mechanism for TURN (draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest)
- RFC5389-bis (Authors TBD)
- RFC5766-bis (Authors TBD).

Goals and Milestones:
