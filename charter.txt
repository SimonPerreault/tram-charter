Turn Revised And Modernized (tram)
----------------------------------

Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) was published as RFC 5766 in April
2010.  Until recently the protocol had only a rather limited deployment.  This
is primarily because its primary use case is as one of the NAT traversal
methods of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) framework (RFC
5245).  This inherent dependency on ICE combined with the fact that ICE itself
was slow to achieve widespread adoption because other alternative mechanisms
were historically used by the VoIP industry were the causes of the initial
lack of interest.  This situation has changed drastically as ICE, and
consequently TURN, are mandatory to implement in WebRTC, which is a set of
technologies developed at the IETF and W3C aiming to enable Real Time
Communication on the Web.

Because of the ubiquity of the Web and of the new opportunities created by the
arrival of WebRTC, there is a renewed interest in TURN and ICE, as evidenced by
the recent work updating the ICE framework, as well as standardizing the URIs
used to access a STUN [RFC7064] or TURN [RFC7065] server.

The goal of the TRAM Working Group is to consolidate the various initiatives
to update TURN and STUN, including the definition of new transport,
authentication mechanisms, and extensions, that make STUN and TURN more suitable
for the WebRTC environment.  The Working Group will closely coordinate with the
appropriate Working Groups, including RTCWEB, MMUSIC, and HTTPBIS.

The current list of deliverable is:

- DTLS transport for TURN

  Candidate draft: draft-petithuguenin-tram-turn-dtls

  TURN defines three transports: UDP, TCP, and TLS. A straightforward extension
  of this set is DTLS, enabling secure datagram-oriented transport.

- New authentication mechanism for TURN

  Problem analysis: draft-reddy-behave-turn-auth
  Candidate draft: draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest, OAuth has also been suggested

  The current authentication mechanism for TURN, which is reused from STUN, has
  been designed with a SIP account database in mind. The new RTCWEB usages,
  which are mostly based on web applications, do not fit that model. A new
  authentication mechanism optimized for such web applications will be created.

- TURN server auto-discovery mechanism for enterprise and ISPs

  Candidate draft: TBD

  Current TURN server discovery is based on the presence of SRV and/or NAPTR DNS
  records. These records are usually under the administrative control of the
  application or service provider, not the enterprise or the ISP on whose
  network the client is situated. Enterprises or ISPs wishing to provide their
  own TURN server, in an attempt to reduce so-called "triangle routing", need a
  new auto-discovery mechanism.

- STUN-bis

  Candidate draft: TBD

  A new revision of RFC 5389 will contain:

  - Various bug fixes
  - STUN hash algorithm agility (currently only SHA-1 is allowed)

- TURN-bis

  Candidate draft: TBD

  A new revision of RFC 5766 will contain:

  - Various bug fixes
  - Support for multi-tenant servers
    (Servers always send the same REALM attribute. No realm negotiation phase
     currently exists.)

Goals and Milestones:

[TBD]
