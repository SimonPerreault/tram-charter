Turn Revised And Modernized (tram)
----------------------------------

TURN was published as RFC 5766 in April 2010.  The protocol had seen a rather
limited deployment since, mostly because its main usage is being one of the
NAT traversal method of the ICE framework (RFC 5245), and ICE was itself slow
to be deployed because other mechanisms were historically used by the VoIP
industry. This situation has changed change drastically as ICE, and so TURN,
is mandatory to implement in WebRTC, which is a set of technologies developed
at the IETF and W3C aiming to enable Real Time Communication on the Web.
Because of the ubiquity of the Web and of the new opportunities created by the
arrival of WebRTC, there is a renewed interest in TURN and in ICE, as seen in
the recent work on updating ICE, or in finalizing the URIs used to resolved
the access to a STUN or TURN server.

The goal of the TRAM Working Group is to consolidate in one place all the
various initiatives in updating TURN and STUN and in defining new mechanisms for
TURN, like authentication or transport, that are more suitable for the WebRTC
environment.  The Working will coordinate with the RTCWeb Working Group.

The current list of deliverable is:

- Websocket transport for TURN (draft-chenxin-behave-turn-websocket)
- DTLS transport for TURN (draft-petithuguenin-tram-turn-dtls)
- New authentication mechanism for TURN (draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest)
- RFC5389-bis (draft TBD)
- RFC5766-bis (draft TBD).

Goals and Milestones:
