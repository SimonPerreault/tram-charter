Turn Revised And Modernized (tram)
----------------------------------

Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) was published as RFC 5766 in April
2010.  Until recently the protocol had only a rather limited deployment.  This
is primarily because its primary use case is as one of the NAT traversal
methods of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) framework (RFC
5245).  This inherent dependency on ICE combined with the fact that ICE itself
was slow to achieve widespread adoption because other alternative mechanisms
were historically used by the VoIP industry were the causes of the initial
lack of interest.  This situation has changed drastically as ICE, and
consequently TURN, are mandatory to implement in WebRTC, which is a set of
technologies developed at the IETF and W3C aiming to enable Real Time
Communication on the Web.

Because of the ubiquity of the Web and of the new opportunities created by the
arrival of WebRTC, there is a renewed interest in TURN and ICE, as evidenced by
the recent work updating the ICE framework, as well as standardizing the URIs
used to access a STUN or TURN server.

The goal of the TRAM Working Group is to consolidate the various initiatives
to update TURN and STUN, including the definition of new transport and
authentication mechanisms that make STUN and TURN more suitable for the WebRTC
environment.  The Working Group will closely coordinate with the appropriate
Working Groups, including RTCWEB and MMUSIC.

The current list of deliverable is:

- Gap analysis for traversal of HTTP proxies
  (draft-hutton-rtcweb-nat-firewall-considerations)
- Protocol for traversal of HTTP proxies (TBD,
  draft-chenxin-behave-turn-websocket is one of several proposals)
- New authentication mechanism for TURN (draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest)
- TURN server auto-discovery mechanism for enterprise and ISPs (draft TBD)
- RFC5389-bis (draft TBD)
- RFC5766-bis (draft TBD)

Goals and Milestones:
